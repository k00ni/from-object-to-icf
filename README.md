# from-object-to-icf

This repository contains technical information around a research project of mine, called from-barrier-to-icf. The project is about a **model** to deduce why a structure/object becomes to a barrier and which groups of people it impedes. Main approach is "ask" which requirements something has (e.g. doors usually force you to not be broader then a certain width) and which [ICF](http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/en/) elements/components it affects.

There is a non-technical documentation available. You can find at: https://www.gitbook.com/book/k00ni/from-barrier-to-icf/details
