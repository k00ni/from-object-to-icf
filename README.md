# from-object-to-icf

This repository contains files and information around a research project of mine. The project is about a **model** to deduce why a structure/object becomes to a barrier and which groups of people it impedes. Main approach is "ask" which requirements something has (e.g. doors usually force you to not be broader then a certain width) and which [ICF](http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/en/) elements/components it affects.

**Background information can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/k00ni/from-object-to-icf/wiki)!**
