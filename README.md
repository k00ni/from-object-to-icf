# from-object-to-icf

This repository contains technical information around a research project of mine, called from-barrier-to-icf. The project is about a **model** to deduce why a structure/object becomes to a barrier and which groups of people it impedes. Main approach is "ask" which requirements something has (e.g. doors usually force you to not be broader then a certain width) and which [ICF](http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/en/) elements/components it affects.

In this [OSF repository](https://osf.io/dqtjs) conceptual and further documentation is collected and maintained. It is the main source and should be a good starting point, if you want to get familiar with this model.

## Current status

I am not able to work on this topic at the moment. But i monitor the Github repository as well as the OSF project closely. So, if you want to contribute or contact me.
